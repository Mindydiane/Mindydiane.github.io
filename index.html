<!-- bio div -->
<div>
<p> I am orignially from Laredo, TX. But have been living in Austin on and off since I was a teenager.</p> 
 <p> I have a dog name Zeus, we enjoy going on new adventures and walks together.</p>
 <p>I worked in hospitality for several years doing Front Desk, Night Audit, Banquets and Housekeeping supervisor.</p> 
<p> Then decided I wanted something different so, I started driving for Lyft and Uber in till I figured it out.</p>  
<p> When I was a teenage My Space was big, it was fun to customize my page.</p> 
<p>  On our free time my friends and I would create websites for fun, that is when I wasn't playing the piano.</p> 
<p> I decided to go back to my old passion and learn how to code, and become a (full-stack) Web Developer.
</p> 
<p> I am very fortunate to be able to start the UT Coding Boot camp class (virtually) in Full Stack Web Development.
